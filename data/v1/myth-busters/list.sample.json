Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.","image":"https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/52.tmb-1920v.png?sfvrsn=862374e_1"},{"title":"Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.","des":"There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5째C to 37째C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.","image":"https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mb-cold-snow.tmb-1920v.png?sfvrsn=1e557ba_1"},{"title":"Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease","des":"Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5째C to 37째C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.","image":"https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mb-mosquito-bite.tmb-1920v.png?sfvrsn=a1d90f6_1"},{"title":"Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?","des":"No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.

Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.","image":"https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mythbusters-27.tmb-1920v.png?sfvrsn=d17bc6bb_1"},{"title":"Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?","des":"UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.","image":"https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/mythbusters-31.tmb-1920v.png?sfvrsn=e5989655_1"},{"title":"How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?","des":"Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.\n\nHowever, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.","image":"https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mythbusters-25.tmb-1920v.png?sfvrsn=d3bf829c_2"},{"title":"Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?","des":"No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.\n\nThe virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.\n\nAlthough these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.","image":"https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/11.tmb-1920v.png?sfvrsn=97f2a51e_2"},{"title":"Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?","des":"No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. \n\nThere is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold.
